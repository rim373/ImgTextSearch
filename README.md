ImageSearchEngine
A Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) system using VGG16 deep learning embeddings, Elasticsearch vector search, and FastAPI backend with HTML frontend.

🏗 Project Pipeline Overview
The project implements a visual similarity search pipeline using deep learning and vector embeddings:

Feature Extraction

Images are processed through VGG16 pre-trained CNN model.
Each image is converted into a 512-dimensional feature vector.
Vectors are L2-normalized for optimal cosine similarity computation.


Vector Storage & Indexing

Embeddings and metadata are indexed in Elasticsearch.
Uses dense_vector type with cosine similarity metric.
Supports fast similarity search across 800K+ images.


Similarity Computation

Cosine similarity measures angular distance between vectors.
Formula: cosine_similarity(A, B) = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)
Range: 0 to 1 (higher = more similar).
Offline: Vectors normalized during indexing.
Online: Query vector compared against indexed vectors using cosine similarity.


Backend API

Built with FastAPI.
Provides endpoints for:

Image upload and feature extraction
Cosine similarity-based search
Returning top-K similar images




Frontend

Built with Vanilla JS, HTML, and CSS.
Features:

Image upload interface
Visual display of similar images
Similarity scores display
Responsive layout






📐 Cosine Similarity in Action
Why Cosine Similarity?
✅ Scale-invariant: Focuses on direction, not magnitude
✅ Efficient: Optimized for high-dimensional spaces
✅ Semantic: Better captures visual similarity than Euclidean distance
✅ Native support: Elasticsearch optimizes cosine similarity queries
Offline vs Online
Offline (Indexing Phase):

Extract VGG16 features from all images
Normalize vectors using L2 normalization
Index normalized vectors in Elasticsearch
Elasticsearch configured with "similarity": "cosine"

Online (Search Phase):

User uploads query image
Extract and normalize VGG16 features
Elasticsearch computes cosine similarity between query vector and all indexed vectors
Return top-K images ranked by similarity score

⚙️ Setup Instructions
Prerequisites

Python ≥ 3.8
Elasticsearch ≥ 8.x
pip or conda
Modern web browser


Step 1: Clone the Repository
bashgit clone https://github.com/yourusername/ImageSearchEngine.git
cd ImageSearchEngine

Step 2: Install Python Dependencies
bashcd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
Key dependencies:

fastapi - Web framework
uvicorn - ASGI server
elasticsearch - ES client
torch / torchvision - VGG16 model
pillow - Image processing
numpy - Vector operations


Step 3: Install and Start Elasticsearch
Download Elasticsearch
bash# Download from: https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch
wget https://artifacts.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-8.x.x-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xzf elasticsearch-8.x.x-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd elasticsearch-8.x.x/
Start Elasticsearch
bashcd bin
./elasticsearch              # Linux/Mac
# or
elasticsearch.bat            # Windows
Elasticsearch runs at: http://localhost:9200
Verify Connection
bashcurl -X GET "http://localhost:9200/"
You should see a JSON response with cluster info.

Step 4: Configure Elasticsearch Index
The index is automatically created with cosine similarity configuration:
json{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "id": { "type": "keyword" },
      "path": { "type": "keyword" },
      "tags": { "type": "text" },
      "embedding": { 
        "type": "dense_vector", 
        "dims": 512,
        "similarity": "cosine"
      }
    }
  }
}
Important: "similarity": "cosine" enables optimized cosine similarity search in Elasticsearch.

Step 5: Index Your Images (Offline Phase)
Place your images in the data/images/ directory, then run:
bashcd backend
python index_images.py
What happens:

Loads each image from data/images/
Extracts 512-D VGG16 features from fc2 layer
Applies L2 normalization: normalized = vector / ||vector||
Creates document with metadata and normalized embedding
Bulk indexes into Elasticsearch

Example indexed document:
json{
  "id": "image_000123",
  "path": "data/images/image_000123.jpg",
  "tags": ["car", "road", "vehicle"],
  "embedding": [0.0123, 0.0456, ..., 0.0012]
}
Processing time: ~0.5-1s per image (depends on hardware)
✅ After indexing completes, 800K+ images ready for cosine similarity search.

Step 6: Start the Backend Server
bashcd backend
uvicorn app:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
API available at: http://localhost:8000
Swagger documentation: http://localhost:8000/docs

Step 7: Open the Frontend
Open frontend/index.html in your browser, or serve it:
bashcd frontend
python -m http.server 3000
Then navigate to: http://localhost:3000

🔍 API Endpoints
POST /search/image
Upload an image and search for visually similar images using cosine similarity.
Request:
bashcurl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/search/image" \
  -F "file=@query_image.jpg" \
  -F "top_k=10"
Response:
json{
  "query_id": "query_12345",
  "results": [
    {
      "id": "image_4521",
      "path": "data/images/image_4521.jpg",
      "score": 0.956,
      "tags": ["road", "car", "urban"]
    },
    {
      "id": "image_8902",
      "path": "data/images/image_8902.jpg",
      "score": 0.943,
      "tags": ["vehicle", "traffic", "highway"]
    }
  ]
}
Score interpretation:

0.95 - 1.0 = Very similar (near-duplicate or same scene)
0.85 - 0.95 = Similar visual content
0.70 - 0.85 = Related features
< 0.70 = Different content

🧠 Technical Deep Dive
VGG16 Feature Extraction
python# Pseudocode
model = VGG16(pretrained=True)
model = model.features  # Remove classification layer
model.eval()

def extract_features(image):
    # Preprocess
    img = resize(image, (224, 224))
    img = normalize(img, mean=[0.485, 0.456, 0.406], std=[0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    
    # Extract
    features = model(img)  # Shape: (512,)
    
    # Normalize for cosine similarity
    features = features / np.linalg.norm(features)  # L2 normalization
    
    return features
Cosine Similarity Computation
python# Offline indexing
for image in dataset:
    vector = extract_features(image)
    vector = normalize_l2(vector)  # Important!
    elasticsearch.index(vector)

# Online search
query_vector = extract_features(query_image)
query_vector = normalize_l2(query_vector)

# Elasticsearch internally computes:
# score = dot_product(query_vector, indexed_vector)
# Because both vectors are L2-normalized, this equals cosine similarity
Why normalization matters:

Cosine similarity = dot product of normalized vectors
cos(θ) = (A·B) / (||A|| × ||B||)
If ||A|| = 1 and ||B|| = 1, then cos(θ) = A·B
This makes computation faster and more efficient
